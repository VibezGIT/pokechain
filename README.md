# The Pokemon Problem

## Rules
Starting with any pokemon, choose another pokemon that starts with the letter that the previous ended with. No repeats.

Example: Bulbasaur -> Rattata -> Abra ...

How long can you go?

## pokedex.json
The pokedex.json file is a simple json array of pokemon name strings. Use this as your source of truth. Lots of new pokemon are coming out soon so just stick with this.

## Submissions
Longest chains should be in a json file of an array of pokemon names. LOWERCASE.

```["bulbasaur", "rattata", "abra"]```
